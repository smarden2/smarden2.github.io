<h1>Baxter</h1>
<p> 	Baxter is a golden retreiver. He definitely the most full of energy 
out of the group. Baxter loves to play catch, run all around the house, and go for long walks
and runs. Baxter's a very happy dog and keeps a positive energy around the house.
I enjoy playing catch with Baxter and taking him on runs with me. Baxter can also
do a few tricks.</p>
