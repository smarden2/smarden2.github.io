<h1>Bailey</h1>
<p> 	Bailey is another golden retreiver, however we just got her this summer.
She is very playful, as you would expect a puppy to be. She can be a little messy
sometimes as she is still working on training! Although Bailey can be a handful,
she is super cute and very playful. </p>
<p> Here are some funny ways Bailey has gotten into trouble!
