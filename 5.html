<h1>Sammy</h1>
<p> 	Sammy is the only cat we have. She is a black cat, I am not
 sure what kind exactly. Sammy is getting old, so she does not do much
 but hide under the beds, particularly my moms bed.  </p>
<p> 	Although Sammy isn't a playful kitten anymore she loves when
my Mom puts out milk for her.  </p>
