<h1>Lucky</h1>
<p> 	Lucky is a dachshund. She is the cuddler of the bunch. She loves to stay inside
and cuddle up on the couch with a blanket. I particularly like this
about her because I am the same way myself. </p>
<p> 	Lucky also loves treats! Whenever she comes in from going on
a walk she's waiting for you expecting to get her favorite treat, a 
spoon full of peanutbutter. </p>
